# ADC: Analog to Digital COnverter
## How it works
Successive Approximation Register Logic
Explain how your project works

## How to test
Apply clk, data (d) and reset(1-reset, 0-functional) then monitor the 4Bit data ate the output.
`conv_done`, indicates when conversion completed.

The logic is part of 4Bit SAR ADC.

## External hardware

No External hardware required except the hardware required to monitor the 4Bit data.
